# Hitch
Cross-platform AirDrop based on Zeroconf

This project uses **Electron** framework to build the Desktop app. A similar implementation in python can be found at: [manthan787/pyhitch](https://github.com/Manthan787/pyhitch). It's not perfect, but if you prefer reading Python over JS check it out.

## Building

To build the desktop app for windows:

``` npm run package-win```

Similarly for mac and linux:

``` npm run package-mac ```

``` npm run package-linux ```
